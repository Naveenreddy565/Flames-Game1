🔥 FLAMES Game – Relationship Predictor
The FLAMES Game is a fun and nostalgic relationship compatibility calculator based on the popular childhood game. It takes two names as input and uses a simple elimination algorithm to determine the nature of the relationship between them—whether it's Friendship, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, or Siblings.

The algorithm compares the letters in both names.
